## __Code Example__
Task "Count characters in your string" from __CodeWars__: \
_The main idea is to count all the occurring characters in a string. If you have a string like aba, then the result should be {'a': 2, 'b': 1}. \
What if the string is empty? Then the result should be empty object literal, {}._
```
function count (string) {  
  let count = {};
  string.split('').forEach(function(c) {
    count[c] ? count[c]++ : count[c] = 1;
  });
  return count;
